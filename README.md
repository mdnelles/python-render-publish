# Navigate to the Project Directory:
First, navigate to the directory where you've extracted the project.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

# Install Dependencies:
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run the Flask Application:
Navigate to the src directory and run the Flask application.

```bash
cd src
python app.py
```

You should see a message indicating that the server is running on http://0.0.0.0:3000/. You can access the application by navigating to this URL in your web browser.

Deactivate the Virtual Environment (if you created one):
Once you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

bash
Copy code
deactivate
If you follow these steps, your Flask application should run without issues on your macOS machine. If you still encounter any problems, let me know so I can assist further!
